## Machine Learning | CareerFoundry

 "Machine learning is the discipline in which machines (computers) iteratively learn from inputs (data). Machine learning is used for analysis of all kinds—for instance, image/face recognition, medical diagnostics, sentiment analysis, email classification, spam filtering, fraud detection, price prediction, and much, much more."

## Overview

### Project Brief: Educational Portal Analysis

This (fictional) portal offers information about courses, institutions, and university programs. Students visit the portal to learn about prices, content, location, employability and other relevant information to make informed decisions about the programs they are interested in. They want to perform an analysis of the 2026 universities ranking which QS, a reputed institution, just published. 

### My objective as a data analyst

Conduct an analysis to answer the question, "Does choosing a university mean trading off between academic quality and job opportunities?"

For this, I used tools like Python and Tableau as well as techniques as linear regression and clustering.


### Key questions

+ What’s the weight of the academic reputation and the employer reputation score on the overall score?

+ Are the academic reputation and the employer reputation correlated?

+ If they are correlated, what could that mean for students and how can that inform them to make their final choice?

+ Another metric included in the 2026 QS Ranking is the employer outcome, which measures how well graduates perform in the job market. Is the employer outcome also correlated with the academic reputation of a university?


### Credits  

The company that conducted the surveys and created the ranking is called [Quacquarelli Symonds](https://www.qs.com/) (QS). The data set is available to public via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashbommidi/2026-qs-world-university-rankings). 

Additionally, I resorted to the QS support page for more info about some of the indicators (variables) used in the ranking, such as [academic reputation](https://support.qs.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4405952675346-Academic-Reputation-Indicator) and [employer reputation](https://support.qs.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4407794203410-Employer-Reputation-Indicator).
